# Infinite Skills
# Reflect on your previous programming experiences and how they might help you in this course

# I took a beginner CS course in highschool and I believe it helped me understand basic concepts like syntax, structure, debugging my own code, and using my problem solving skills.

# If I had infinite programming skills, I'd create a personalized AI Health assistant that hospitals and people around the world can use.

# Goal for this course: Go from beginner to at least close to intermediate level in programming.

# It would be awesome to create a program for my aunt and uncle's garbage disposal company to use for when the drivers need a specialized route created for them to make the job easier and safer.

# Creating a super secured smart home management system could be incredibly efficient and integrate eith various smart devices and systems in a home.

# Creating a program for the better of education sounds really intruiging. A personalized learning platform could be tailored to each specific student based on learning styles, weaknesses, strengths, and progress speed.
